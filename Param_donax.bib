abstract = {We describe spatio-temporal variability of primary production (PP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration with environmental parameters during March-December 2010 period in the south-eastern coast of the Black Sea. PP was measured by a combination of 14C in-situ incubation experiments on natural phytoplankton assemblages. Primary production rates, varied notably within water column with 0.1-40 mg cm-3 d-1, were always determined in the upper part of the euphotic zone down to the 10{\%} of light intensity depth. The depth-integrated production rates ranged from 285 to 565 mg cm-2 d-1 for the coastal station and from 126 to 530 mg cm-2 d-1 for the offshore station (ANOVA, P{\textgreater}0.05). The average Chl-a concentrations within the euphotic zone ranged from 0.30 to 3.57 µg L-1 for the coastal station and from 0.25 to 3.45 µg L-1 for the offshore station (ANOVA, P{\textless}0.01), whereas the levels of depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations in the offshore station (9-80 mg m-2) were greater than in the coastal station (10 to 68 mg m-2) (ANOVA, P{\textgreater}0.05). The correlation between integrated PP and Chl-a values for the coastal station (r2= 0.98; P{\textless}0.01) was better than for the offshore station (r2= 0.12; P{\textgreater}0.05).},

abstract = {This study aimed to augment existing knowledge of the reproductive characteristics of Donax trunculus through analysis of timing variations and the influence of shell size on partial fecundity (PF) during the reproductive period. To achieve this objective, two reproductive timing characteristics were also studied: size at first maturity (SL50) and the reproductive cycle using histology and image analysis techniques. SL50 was 10.83 mm for females and 10.86 for males. Donax trunculus showed a continuous and simultaneous release of gametes and high oocyte regeneration ability during the reproductive period (from February to July). These reproductive characteristics impeded the estimation of total fecundity. However, throughout the reproductive period an increasing pattern of PF was observed followed by a significant drop at the end of the same period, which could be quantified (293,390 of vitellogenic and ripe oocytes). At the same time PF quantifications allowed for predicting and estimating the influence of shell length (SL) on the reproductive output as a function of oocyte typology (PF = 4.12 + 3.96 SL; r 2 = 0.86; all types). Levels of prevalence of a digenetic trematode-like parasite with castrate ability fluctuated between 0-20{\%} depending on the time of the year and sex. In addition, the possible consequences of two different scenarios of population size structure on the reproductive output were simulated, and highlighted how beach areas supporting high levels of anthropogenic pressure (Isla Canela) could compromise future recruitments, producing 84{\%} less oocytes than a beach with a lower level of disturbance (Do{\~{n}}ana).},

abstract = {The main objectives of this study were (i) to provide an updated age-length key for D. trunculus from Atlantic waters, and (ii) to evaluate population dynamics, the timing of recruitment and production parameters of the wedge clam Donax trunculus in two moderately exposed sandy beaches (the protected area of Do{\~{n}}ana National Park and the tourist destination of Isla Canela) along the littoral of Huelva (SW Spain). First an in-depth analysis of the shell and updated estimation of growth parameters of the intertidal D. trunculus population were performed between January 2014 and July 2015 using two different methods i) thin-layer cross section (TL) (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD). Von Bertalanffy growth functions provided an asymptotic length of 46 mm (LFD) and 46.7 mm (TL) and growth constants of 0.48 (LFD) and 0.47 yr−1 (TL) in Do{\~{n}}ana beach. In addition, several deformities as well as signs of shell repair were observed. Population dynamics analyses through length-frequency distribution clarified the timing of recruitment (February–March and July). The mean annual biomass (B¯) of intertidal populations of D. trunculus ranged between 3.03 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 3.31 g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) m−2 yr−1 (Isla Canela). Individual production showed the highest value at 27 mm length (0.117 g AFDW m−2 yr−1) and annual production (P) ranged between 3.40 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 4.91 g (Isla Canela), resulting in renewal rate (P/B¯) values between 1.03 and 1.61, respectively. The present results, together with information on environmental parameters, revealed clear differences in population dynamics and production between beaches related to the presence or absence of a protection figure.},

abstract = {The shell growth and reproductive cycle of Donax trunculus (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from southern Portugal were studied from December 1993 to November 1994. Both the acetate peel method and quantification of surface growth rings were used to establish age and estimate growth rate. Widely spaced growth bands were formed in spring and summer whilst narrowly spaced bands were deposited in late summer and early autumn. No cessation of growth was observed during the winter. The von Bertalanffy growth curve estimated from the internal bands did not differ significantly from that obtained from the surface rings. However, the age of clams can be determined more accurately from acetate peels than directly from surface rings. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that periodicity of the deposition of microgrowth bands was related to an innate rhythm. Gonadal development was monitored using standard histological methods. Both males and females showed synchronism in gonadal development. The gametogenic cycle began in late November and ended in late August. Spawning occurred between March and August with two major spawning phases: March and May-August. D. trunculus reached maturity during the first year of life.},

Five collecting areas were sampled in the Ria Formosa barrier islands, namely in the Culatra, Barreta and Armona Islands, between March and June 1998. The study was based on size frequency distribution analysis and shell biometric relationships. The size frequency distribution showed the predominance of smaller individuals ({\textless}25 mm) in the renewal area (0.5-1.0 m depth) and the prevalence of larger individuals (≥25 mm) at greater depths (4.0-6.0 m depth). The biometric study revealed the existence of significant differences in the type of growth between size classes in relation to depth distribution and burrowing activity. On the basis of these results, some specific management measures were proposed for this important bivalve fishery, taking into account the distinct fishing strategies and operations (manual and boat-operated dredging) performed at different depths.},

abstract = {The study of the structure and the dynamics of populations exposed to environmental pollutants can be a useful investigative tool for finding the connections between different levels of biological organization Population dynamics on wedge clam, Donax trunculus is still unknown in Morocco. FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools) was used for calculating population parameters of this species. The specimens of D. trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) were collected monthly in the Agadir Marine Bay (South of Morocco) for two years (January 2016–December 2017) from three stations (S1, S2 and S3), which are directly exposed to eventual pollutants owing to the developing tourism resort Taghazout Bay. The study of the population dynamics of D. trunculus shows that the annual mean of density, biomass and condition index, presents significant seasonal variations depending on the physico-chemical parameters and the animal's life cycle. The monitoring of age-class frequency distributions of D. trunculus individuals revealed a slighter difference at the three study stations. Asymptotic length (L∞) was 37.96 mm and growth coefficient (K) was estimated at 1.93 year −1. Total mortality (Z) for D. trunculus was 3.30 year −1. Natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were 1.73 year−1 and 1.57 year −1 respectively. Exploitation level (E) was computed as 0.48, indicating an optimum level of exploitation of D. trunculus in the coastal waters of Taghazout. It is well demonstrated that bimodal recruitment takes place twice a year; one in late summer–early autumn and the other in spring. The results of this study provide information on the health status of this ecosystem receiving Taghazout Bay project.},

abstract = {In a resource management perspective, the understanding of the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge clam Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz) to the north-western Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction with the exception of the protected Do{\~{n}}ana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential. Therefore, our results emphasized the necessity of protection of this economic resource and the validity of molecular tools to evaluate the population dynamics.},

abstract = {This study was the first attempt to characterize the recreational harvesting of the wedge clam (Donax trunculus). For this purpose, 403 face-to-face interviews were performed in the summers of 2018 and 2019 in southern Portugal. The majority of the harvesters frequented the selected beaches during holidays and collected wedge clams as a hobby for an appetizer. The respondents reported an inter-annual variation in their catches of wedge clam with a decreasing abundance in 2018 followed by a recovery in 2019, but with more recreational harvesters collecting undersized individuals. Although most harvesters declared to consume D. trunculus, only a few bought wedge clams being the clams' size a secondary factor in their valorization. The majority of the recreational harvesters did not know the species' minimum conservation reference size nor the legally allowed maximum daily catch. It was estimated that recreational harvesters can collect 13 tonnes of wedge clams during the summer season along the southeastern coast of Algarve. Even though manual harvesting is not an efficient fishing technique, the lack of selectivity of harvesters can eventually compromise the resilience of D. trunculus populations. Despite most respondents affirmed to get informed about marine biotoxins, most surveys were done during periods of interdiction for shellfish harvesting. The present results revealed that the population is still unaware of the health risks of consuming shellfish contaminated with biotoxins. Educational activities and awareness campaigns are required to further inform recreational harvesters about the regulations in force for this activity and the sanitary threats of marine biotoxins.},

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},
